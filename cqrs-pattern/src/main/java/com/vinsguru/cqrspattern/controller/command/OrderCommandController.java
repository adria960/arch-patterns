/*
    So based on a property, we change if the app is going to behave like a read-only node or write-only node.
    It gives us the ability to run multiple instances of an app with different modes.
    I can have 1 instance of my app which does the writing while
    I can have multiple instances of my app just for serving the read requests.
    They can be scaled in-out independently.
    We can place them behind a load balancer / proxy like nginx â€“ so that READ / WRITE requests could be forwarded to
    appropriate instances using path based routing or some other mechanism.
